# Madhav_Store_PowerBi_Dashboard
This Dashboard is designed to analyze and represent sales data for "Madhav Ecommerce". We have analyzed profits for various parameters such as monthly and category-wise. Moreover we have also highlighted value customers for giving them preference and special offers to increase retention. A broad view of over all sales and performance of store is depicted keeping accuracy and meaningfulness in mind.

Some key takeways:
1. Clothing is the segment counting for unparalleled quantity, can be planned for more investment to convert the quantity into profits.
2. Though online payment systems collectively accounted more transactions, cash on delivery still takes the major chunk. Maintaining status of COD, online payments should also be made more hassle-free in order to promote cashless transactions.
3. Maharashtra and MP attracted majority of orders, capturing more market should be planned in these two states along with expanding in other states such as UP and Goa.
4. Some most valuable customers are highlighted, Mr. Harivansh and Mr. Madhav being on top. These customers should be provided with offers and goodies in order to retain them as well as motivating other customers for better retention.


The insights and planning advised are solely created by me after researching about the marketing and ecommerce behavior.
